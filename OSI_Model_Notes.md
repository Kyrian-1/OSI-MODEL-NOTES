OSI Model Layers
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven layers.

1. Physical Layer
Function: Transmits raw bit streams over a physical medium.
Examples: Cables, hubs, network interface cards (NICs).
Key Tasks: Defines electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications for devices and media.
2. Data Link Layer
Function: Provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error correction from the physical layer.
Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, switches.
Key Tasks: Framing, error detection/correction, and media access control (MAC).
3. Network Layer
Function: Manages device addressing, tracks the location of devices, and determines the best path for data transfer.
Examples: IP (IPv4/IPv6), routers.
Key Tasks: Logical addressing, routing, and packet forwarding.
4. Transport Layer
Function: Provides reliable data transfer services to the upper layers.
Examples: TCP, UDP.
Key Tasks: Segmentation, flow control, error control, and connection establishment.
5. Session Layer
Function: Establishes, manages, and terminates connections between local and remote applications.
Examples: NetBIOS, RPC.
Key Tasks: Session setup, coordination, and recovery.
6. Presentation Layer
Function: Translates data between the application layer and the network format.
Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, GIF.
Key Tasks: Data encryption, compression, and translation.
7. Application Layer
Function: Provides network services directly to end-user applications.
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.
Key Tasks: User interface, data access, and application-specific services.
